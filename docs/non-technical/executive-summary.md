# Executive Summary

## Vision

Project Horizon establishes a unified, open-source Zero Trust Architecture that demonstrates how modern enterprises can achieve end-to-end visibility, control, and automation across identity, data, workload, and detection domains without reliance on proprietary platforms.  
The initiative represents a tangible blueprint for how organizations can transition from static perimeter defense to dynamic, identity-driven security grounded in the principle of “never trust, always verify.”

## Objectives

The project was conceived to achieve the following core objectives:

1. **Integration of Security Domains** – Combine identity, data, workload, and behavioral analytics into a single, observable ecosystem.  
2. **Continuous Trust Validation** – Implement adaptive, policy-driven access and continuous verification for all users, devices, and services.  
3. **Automation and Detection** – Demonstrate automated threat detection, enrichment, and response using open-source telemetry pipelines.  
4. **Cost Efficiency and Transparency** – Prove that enterprise-grade security outcomes can be realized through fully open-source toolchains.  
5. **Compliance Enablement** – Provide inherent support for audit, data-protection, and regulatory alignment through integrated visibility.

## Strategic Scope

Project Horizon encompasses five technical pillars that collectively embody the Zero Trust model:

| Pillar | Focus Area | Core Outcome |
|:-------|:------------|:-------------|
| **ZTNA & SASE** | Identity-driven access enforcement using Keycloak and Pomerium | Eliminated implicit trust; enforced TLS-based, per-session authorization |
| **CDP** | Behavioral analytics and customer churn intelligence | Delivered proactive user insights and automated communication workflows |
| **DSPM** | Data discovery, classification, and policy enforcement | Enabled automated remediation of exposed or misconfigured data assets |
| **CNAPP** | Container and workload protection | Secured the build-deploy-runtime pipeline for Kubernetes workloads |
| **XDR + UEBA** | Centralized detection and behavioral correlation | Unified telemetry and machine-learning-based anomaly detection |

## Key Achievements

- Deployed a fully functional Zero Trust ecosystem integrating all five pillars.  
- Achieved complete observability through the Elastic Stack, consolidating infrastructure, identity, and behavioral telemetry.  
- Implemented automated policy enforcement and runtime threat detection using Kyverno, Falco, and Trivy.  
- Validated end-to-end data classification and real-time remediation with MinIO, NiFi, Presidio, and Cloud Custodian.  
- Delivered an operational UEBA pipeline for SSH and behavioral anomaly detection.  
- Produced detailed dashboards and reports demonstrating measurable security posture improvement.

## Business Impact

- **Operational Visibility:** Single-pane insight into all security layers, reducing detection latency.  
- **Policy Consistency:** Uniform enforcement across identity, workload, and data boundaries.  
- **Compliance Readiness:** Evidence of automated control validation and continuous monitoring.  
- **Cost Optimization:** Entirely open-source stack, eliminating licensing expenditures.  
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture adaptable to multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructures.

## Conclusion

Project Horizon conclusively demonstrates that Zero Trust transformation is attainable through transparent, interoperable, and community-driven technologies.  
It establishes a replicable reference model for secure-by-design architecture and lays the groundwork for future enterprise expansion into fully automated, intelligence-driven cybersecurity.
